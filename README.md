## üéØ Quick Start

### üê≥ Run with Docker

Choose your edition and get started in seconds:

```bash
# üÜì Community Edition (Perfect for development)
docker run -d -p 5000:5000 --name my-community-gateway farisbahdlor/grapthway:community-v1.5
```

### üîë Get Your Tokens

```bash
curl http://localhost:5000/start
```

> üí° **Pro Tip**: Store your admin tokens securely‚Äîyou'll need them for service registration and dashboard access.

### üé™ Register Your First Service

Announce your service to the gateway. The gateway is smart enough to handle the rest.

```javascript
// In your microservice
async function registerWithGateway() {
  const response = await fetch(`http://gateway:5000/health?token=${ADMIN_TOKEN}`, {
    method: 'POST',
    headers: { 'Content-Type': 'application/json' },
    body: JSON.stringify({
      service: 'user-service',
      url: 'http://user-service:4000/graphql',
      subgraph: 'auth', // Define which subgraph this service belongs to
      schema: `
        type User { id: ID!, email: String!, name: String! }
        type Query { me: User }
      `,
      middlewareMap: { /* Pipeline definitions */ },
      stitchingConfig: { /* Schema extensions */ }
    })
  });
}

// Keep your service alive by re-announcing periodically
setInterval(registerWithGateway, 20000);
```

## ‚ú® Smart Deployments: Version-Aware Registration

Grapthway eliminates manual deployment orchestration by intelligently detecting version changes to perform zero-downtime Blue-Green deployments.

When a service instance announces its health, the gateway compares its full configuration (Schema, Pipelines, and Stitching) to the currently active version.

#### Real-World Example: Deploying a Breaking Change

Imagine your `store-product-service` **v1 (Blue)** is live. Its `createProduct` mutation takes `name` and `price` as separate arguments.

1. **You Deploy v2 (Green):** You refactor the service and change the `createProduct` mutation to accept a single `ProductInput` object. This is a breaking schema change. You deploy this new container.
2. **"Green" Service Registers:** The new `v2` service starts and announces itself to the gateway's `/health` endpoint, sending its new schema.
3. **Gateway Detects the Change:** The gateway's `UpdateServiceRegistration` function compares the incoming schema from `v2` with the stored schema from `v1` and sees they are different.
4. **The Swap is Triggered:** Recognizing a new version, the gateway performs a Blue-Green Swap:
   * It instantly **wipes its list of "blue" (v1) instances**.
   * It creates a new active set of instances containing only the new "green" (v2) service.
   * It **atomically replaces** the stored schema, pipelines, and stitching rules with the new ones from `v2`.
5. **Result:** The cutover is instant. All new GraphQL requests are now routed exclusively to `store-product-service-v2` and validated against its new schema.

If a subsequent instance of `v2` registers with the *same* configuration, the gateway recognizes it as a **Scale-Up Event** and simply adds it to the load-balancing pool for the active "green" version.

## üèóÔ∏è Advanced Examples

### üõí E-commerce Checkout Pipeline (Atomic Swaps & Global Services in Action)

This example demonstrates how Grapthway handles complex workflows that touch multiple services, all managed as a single, atomic configuration.

```javascript
// This entire configuration is sent by your store-product-service
const MIDDLEWARE_MAP = {
  // This pipeline runs for the 'payCart' mutation.
  "payCart": {
    // 'pre' steps run before the main resolver.
    "pre": [
      {
        // 1. Call the Global 'auth-service' for Authentication.
        //    Even if this request is for the "store" subgraph, the gateway
        //    finds 'auth-service' in any subgraph.
        "service": "auth-service",
        "field": "getUserData",
        "passHeaders": ["Authorization"],
        "selection": ["user { id }"],
        // 2. The result is saved to the request context as `user`.
        "assign": { "user": "user" }
      },
      {
        // 3. Next, call the cart service.
        "service": "cart-service",
        "field": "getCartItems",
        //    The gateway automatically adds the `X-Ctx-User` header from the previous step.
        "passHeaders": ["Authorization"],
        "selection": ["id", "storeId"],
        // 4. The result is saved to the context as `cartItems`.
        "assign": { "cartItems": "" },
        "onError": {
          "rollback": [{ "service": "inventory-service", "field": "releaseItems" }]
        }
      }
    ],
    // 'post' steps run *after* the main resolver to enrich the response.
    "post": [
      {
        "service": "balance-service",
        "field": "getUserBalance",
        // 5. Map the `userId` from the main resolver's output to this enrichment query's arguments.
        "argsMapping": { "userId": "userId" }, 
        "selection": ["amount", "updatedAt"],
        // 6. The result is merged into the final response as `finalBalance`.
        "assign": { "finalBalance": "" } 
      }
    ]
  }
}
```

This entire `MIDDLEWARE_MAP` is treated as a single, **atomic unit**. When you deploy a new version of `store-product-service` with changes to this map, the gateway swaps the entire configuration at once, ensuring perfect consistency.

### üîó Dynamic Schema Stitching

Extend types across service boundaries seamlessly:

```javascript
// In your order-service, extend the User type from auth-service.
const stitchingConfig = {
  "User": { // Target type to extend
    "orderHistory": { // New field to add to the User type
      "service": "order-service",
      "resolverField": "getOrdersByUserId",
      // Map the User's `id` to the `userId` argument of the resolver.
      "argsMapping": { "userId": "id" } 
    }
  }
};
```

## ‚ö° Performance Optimization Report

We've implemented key optimizations that deliver measurable performance gains while fixing critical GraphQL handling issues.

### üìä Load Test Results

| Metric | Before | After | Improvement |
|--------|--------|-------|-------------|
| **Requests/sec** | 13.97 RPS | 14.41 RPS | **+3.1%** ‚¨ÜÔ∏è |
| **P95 Latency** | 257.23 ms | 239.72 ms | **-17.51 ms** ‚¨áÔ∏è |
| **Error Rate** | 0.0% | 0.0% | Maintained |

> **Test Environment**: 5 Virtual Users over 2m 20s duration

### üîß Key Optimizations

#### 1. High-Performance JSON Processing
- **Change**: Replaced `encoding/json` with `json-iterator/go`
- **Impact**: Faster JSON operations across all API requests, logging, and downstream communication

#### 2. Lock-Free Schema Reloading
- **Change**: Implemented atomic schema updates using `sync/atomic.Value`
- **Impact**: Zero-downtime schema reloads with no request blocking
- **Before**: `sync.RWMutex` caused lock contention
- **After**: Non-blocking background schema builds with atomic swaps

#### 3. GraphQL Query Optimization
- **Fixed**: Scalar return type handling (removed unnecessary `__typename` injection)
- **Fixed**: Input object formatting (proper GraphQL syntax instead of JSON strings)
- **Impact**: Cleaner query generation and improved downstream service compatibility

**Examples of Fixed Queries:**

*Before (Broken):*
```javascript
# Scalar queries incorrectly added __typename
logout(token: "abc123") { __typename }  # ‚ùå Invalid for String return

# Input objects formatted as JSON strings
editUser(input: "{\"name\":\"faris\",\"age\":25}")  # ‚ùå Invalid syntax
```

*After (Fixed):*
```javascript
# Scalar queries return clean values
logout(token: "abc123")  # ‚úÖ Proper scalar handling

# Input objects use proper GraphQL syntax
editUser(input: {name: "faris", age: 25})  # ‚úÖ Correct formatting
```

### üéØ Technical Benefits

- **6.8% latency reduction** - Faster response times for end users
- **Zero downtime** schema updates - No service interruption during configuration changes
- **100% compatibility** - Drop-in JSON replacement maintains existing functionality
- **Memory efficiency** - Reduced lock contention and reflection overhead

### üîç Implementation Details

The optimizations focus on eliminating performance bottlenecks:

```go
// Lock-free schema reloading
func (m *Merger) ReloadSchema() {
    // Build new schemas in background
    newSchema := buildSchema()
    // Atomic swap - zero blocking
    m.schemaValue.Store(newSchema)
}

// Optimized input formatting
func formatValue(value interface{}) string {
    // Converts {"name":"faris"} ‚Üí {name: "faris"}
    // Handles nested objects recursively
}
```

*These optimizations maintain backward compatibility while delivering measurable performance improvements. No changes required to existing resolvers or schemas.*
