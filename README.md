## üèóÔ∏è Architecture

### System Architecture (v2.0)

The v2.0 architecture introduces a unified Pipeline Executor at its core. This central component is responsible for orchestrating workflows for both GraphQL and REST requests, ensuring consistent logic for tasks like authentication, data enrichment, and logging. For REST routes without a defined pipeline, the gateway bypasses the executor and uses a high-performance reverse proxy to minimize latency.

#### Unified Request Flow

```mermaid
graph TD
    A[Client Request] --> B{GraphQL or REST?};
    B -- GraphQL --> C[GraphQL Handler];
    B -- REST --> D[REST Proxy Handler];

    C --> E{Pipeline Configured?};
    D --> E;
    
    E -- Yes --> F[Unified Pipeline Executor];
    F -- Pre-Pipeline --> G[Proxy to Downstream Service];
    G -- Response --> F;
    F -- Post-Pipeline --> H[Compose Final Response];
    
    E -- No (REST Only) --> I[High-Speed Reverse Proxy];
    I --> G;
    H --> Z[Client Response];
```

#### Pipeline Executor Logic

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
    participant Handler as Request Handler
    participant Executor as Pipeline Executor
    participant Service as Downstream Service
    
    Handler->>Executor: ExecutePrePipeline(config, context)
    Executor->>Service: Execute Step 1 (e.g., Auth)
    Service-->>Executor: Step 1 Response
    Executor->>Executor: Update Context
    Executor->>Service: Execute Step 2 (e.g., Get Data)
    Service-->>Executor: Step 2 Response
    Executor-->>Handler: Return Pipeline Context
    
    Handler->>Service: Main Request
    Service-->>Handler: Main Response

    Handler->>Executor: ExecutePostPipeline(config, mainResponse)
    Executor->>Service: Enrichment Call
    Service-->>Executor: Enrichment Data
    Executor-->>Handler: Merged Final Data
```

### GraphQL Schema Stitching

Schema stitching allows you to extend types defined in one service with fields resolved by another, creating a rich, interconnected data graph. This feature is specific to GraphQL services.

```mermaid
graph TD
    subgraph "Unified Schema (in Gateway)"
        C["type User { id: ID, name: String, orderHistory: [Order] }"]
    end
    
    subgraph "user-service"
        A["type User { id: ID, name: String }"]
    end
    
    subgraph "order-service"
        B["type Query { getOrdersByUserId(userId: ID!): [Order] }"]
    end
    
    C -- Stitched from --> A;
    C -- Extended with field resolved by --> B;
```

## üéØ Quick Start

### üê≥ Run with Docker

Choose your edition and get started in seconds with the new v2.0 images:

```bash
# üÜì Community Edition (Perfect for development)
docker run -d -p 5000:5000 --name my-community-gateway farisbahdlor/grapthway:community-v2.0

# üè¢ Enterprise Edition (Requires Redis for persistence)
docker run -d -p 5000:5000 \
  -e STORAGE_TYPE=redis \
  -e REDIS_ADDR=your-redis-host:6379 \
  --name my-enterprise-gateway farisbahdlor/grapthway:enterprise-v2.0
```

### üîë Get Your Tokens

On the first run, initialize the gateway to get your admin tokens:

```bash
curl http://localhost:5000/start
```

üí° **Pro Tip**: Store your admin tokens securely‚Äîyou'll need them for service registration and dashboard access. Enterprise users with Redis only need to do this once.

### üé™ Register Your First Service

From your microservice, send a POST request to `/admin/health` every 30 seconds. This single payload can now define all your service's pipelines, for both GraphQL and REST.

#### GraphQL-Only Service

```javascript
// Example: A GraphQL-only authentication service
{
  "service": "auth-service", // The unique name of your service.
  "url": "http://auth-internal:4001/graphql", // The internal address of your service.
  "type": "graphql", // The primary type of this service.
  "subgraph": "auth", // The logical group this service's schema belongs to.
  "schema": "type User { ... } type Mutation { login(user: String!): String }", // The GraphQL schema definition.
  
  // Defines pipelines for specific GraphQL fields.
  "middlewareMap": {
    "login": { // This pipeline attaches to the 'login' mutation.
      "pre": [
        {
          "service": "rate-limiter-rest", // Call a REST service before the main mutation.
          "method": "POST",
          "path": "/check",
          "onError": { "stop": true } // If the rate-limiter fails, stop the entire request.
        }
      ]
    }
  },

  // Defines how to "stitch" fields from this service onto types from other services.
  "stitchingConfig": {
    "User": { // Extend the 'User' type.
      "authInfo": { // With a new field called 'authInfo'.
        "service": "auth-service", // This service will provide the data.
        "resolverField": "getUserById", // By calling its 'getUserById' query.
        "argsMapping": { "id": "id" } // Map the parent User's 'id' to the resolver's 'id' argument.
      }
    }
  }
}
```

#### REST-Only Service

```javascript
// Example: A REST-only legacy inventory service
{
  "service": "inventory-api", // The unique name for the REST service.
  "url": "http://inventory-legacy:3000", // The base URL for the service.
  "type": "rest", // The service type is REST.
  "path": "/v1/inventory", // The base path prefix for all routes from this service.
  
  // Defines pipelines for specific REST routes.
  "restPipelines": {
    "POST /v1/inventory/update": { // Attaches to the 'POST' method on this specific route.
      "pre": [
        {
          "service": "auth-service", // A GraphQL service used for auth.
          "field": "verifyAdmin", // Call this GraphQL field.
          "passHeaders": ["Authorization"], // Pass the auth header from the original request.
          "onError": { "stop": true } // If auth fails, stop the request.
        }
      ]
    }
  }
}
```

#### Hybrid Service

```javascript
// Example: A hybrid service with both GraphQL and REST capabilities
{
  "service": "products-service",
  "url": "http://products-service-internal:8000",
  "type": "graphql", // The primary type. REST routes are an addition.
  "subgraph": "products",
  "schema": "type Query { getProduct(id: ID!): Product } type Product { id: ID name: String }",
  
  // Pipelines for GraphQL fields.
  "middlewareMap": {
    "getProduct": {
      "pre": [{
        "service": "auth-service",
        "field": "validateSession",
        "onError": { "stop": true }
      }]
    }
  },

  // Pipelines for REST endpoints also served by this service.
  "restPipelines": {
    "POST /products/{id}/inventory": {
       "pre": [{
        "service": "auth-service",
        "field": "verifyAdmin",
        "onError": { "stop": true }
      }]
    }
  },

  // Schema stitching configuration.
  "stitchingConfig": {
    "Order": { // Extends the 'Order' type (defined in another service).
      "productDetails": { // Adds a 'productDetails' field.
        "service": "products-service", // This service resolves the field.
        "resolverField": "getProduct", // Using its 'getProduct' query.
        "argsMapping": { "id": "productId" } // Maps the parent Order's 'productId' to the 'id' argument.
      }
    }
  }
}
```

## üèóÔ∏è Advanced Examples

### üõí E-commerce Order Placement

A user places an order via a GraphQL mutation. The pipeline validates the user (GraphQL), checks stock (REST), and after the main mutation, sends a confirmation email (REST).

```javascript
// Attached to GraphQL mutation: placeOrder(items: [ItemInput!]): Order
// This mutation is assumed to return an object like: { "id": "ord_123", "buyerId": "usr_456", "total": 99.99 }
{
  "placeOrder": {
    "pre": [
      {
        // 1. First, call the 'auth-service-gql' GraphQL service to validate the user session.
        "service": "auth-service-gql",
        "field": "validateSession",
        "passHeaders": ["Authorization"],
        "selection": ["user { id email }"], // Only ask for the fields we need.
        "assign": { "userContext": "user" }, // Assign the 'user' object from the response to the 'userContext' key in the pipeline context.
        "onError": { "stop": true } // If this fails, stop the entire process.
      },
      {
        // 2. Next, call the 'inventory-api-rest' REST service to check stock.
        "service": "inventory-api-rest",
        "method": "POST",
        "path": "/v1/stock/check-availability",
        "bodyMapping": { 
          // Get the 'items' from the original GraphQL mutation arguments and map them to the request body.
          "items_to_check": "args.items" 
        },
        "onError": { "stop": true }
      }
    ],
    "post": [
      {
        // 3. After the main 'placeOrder' mutation succeeds, call the email REST service.
        "service": "email-api-rest",
        "method": "POST",
        "path": "/v2/send/order-confirmation",
        "bodyMapping": {
            // Get the user's email from the context we saved in the 'pre' step.
            "recipient_email": "userContext.email",
            // Get the 'id' field from the main 'placeOrder' mutation's response.
            "order_id": "id",
             // Get the 'total' field from the main 'placeOrder' mutation's response.
            "order_total": "total"
        },
        "concurrent": true // Run this as fire-and-forget; don't wait for it to complete.
      }
    ]
  }
}
```

### üì± Social Media Post Creation (REST-first)

A user creates a post via a POST to a REST endpoint. The pipeline validates the session (GraphQL), runs content moderation (REST), and after success, notifies followers (GraphQL).

```javascript
// Attached to REST endpoint: POST /v3/posts
// The main REST handler is assumed to return a response like: { "id": "post_789", "content": "..." }
{
  "POST /v3/posts": {
    "pre": [
      {
        // 1. Authenticate the user via a GraphQL call.
        "service": "user-session-gql",
        "field": "getActiveUser",
        "passHeaders": ["Authorization"],
        "selection": ["id"],
        "assign": { "user": "" }, // Assign the entire response object (e.g., { "id": "..." }) to the 'user' key.
        "onError": { "stop": true }
      },
      {
        // 2. Run the post content through a moderation REST API.
        "service": "moderation-api-rest",
        "method": "POST",
        "path": "/filter/text",
        "bodyMapping": { 
          // Get the 'content' from the body of the original REST request.
          "text_content": "request.body.content" 
        },
        "onError": { "stop": true }
      }
    ],
    "post": [
      {
        // 3. After the post is created, trigger a GraphQL mutation to notify followers.
        "service": "notification-gql",
        "operation": "mutation",
        "field": "notifyFollowersOfNewPost",
        "argsMapping": { 
            // Map the 'id' from the main REST response to the 'postId' argument.
            "postId": "id", 
            // Map the user's ID from the context (set in the 'pre' step) to the 'authorId' argument.
            "authorId": "user.id"
        },
        "concurrent": true
      }
    ]
  }
}
```

### üí≥ Financial Transaction with Rollback

A pre pipeline step authorizes a payment (REST). A subsequent step to reserve tickets (GraphQL) fails, triggering a rollback that calls the payment provider's void endpoint to cancel the authorization.

```javascript
// Attached to GraphQL mutation: reserveTickets(showId: ID!, quantity: Int!)
{
  "reserveTickets": {
    "pre": [
       {
        // 1. Authorize payment with a third-party REST API.
        "service": "payment-provider-api",
        "method": "POST",
        "path": "/v1/authorize_payment",
        "bodyMapping": {
            // Use data from the GraphQL arguments.
            "amount": "args.ticketPrice",
            "currency": "USD", // Use a static value.
            "card_token": "args.paymentToken"
        },
        "assign": { "paymentAuth": "" }, // Store the entire auth response (e.g., { "transactionId": "..." }) in the context.
        "onError": { "stop": true }
      },
      {
         // 2. Attempt to reserve tickets. Let's assume this step fails.
         "service": "ticketing-service-gql",
         "field": "createReservation",
         "argsMapping": { "showId": "args.showId" },
         "assign": { "reservation": ""},
         // Because this blocking step failed, the 'rollback' action is triggered.
         "onError": {
            "stop": true,
            "rollback": [
              {
                // This is the compensating action: void the payment authorization.
                "service": "payment-provider-api",
                "method": "POST",
                "path": "/v1/void_authorization",
                "bodyMapping": {
                  // Get the transaction ID from the context we saved in the first step.
                  "authorization_id": "paymentAuth.transactionId",
                  // Provide a static reason code for the void action.
                  "reason_code": "INVENTORY_UNAVAILABLE"
                }
              }
            ]
         }
      }
    ]
  }
}
```

### üåê IoT Data Ingestion & Alerting

An IoT device sends data to a REST endpoint. A post pipeline checks for anomalies (GraphQL) and, if an alert is found, sends a notification to a Slack webhook (REST).

```javascript
// Attached to REST endpoint: POST /ingest/telemetry
{
  "POST /ingest/telemetry": {
    "pre": [{
        // 1. Validate the device's token before processing the telemetry data.
        "service": "device-auth-api",
        "method": "POST",
        "path": "/token/introspect",
        "passHeaders": ["X-Device-Token"],
        "assign": { "device": "" }, // Store device info in the context.
        "onError": { "stop": true }
    }],
    "post": [
      {
        // 2. After data ingestion, call a GraphQL service to check for anomalies. This call is blocking.
        "service": "anomaly-detection-gql",
        "field": "analyzeTelemetry",
        "argsMapping": { "payload": "payload" }, // Assumes main handler returns { "payload": ... }
        "selection": ["alert { level message }"],
        "assign": { "anomalyResult": "" }, // Store the analysis result in the context.
        "concurrent": false // 'false' is default, but explicit here. The next step depends on this result.
      },
      {
        // 3. This step runs after the anomaly check. It will send a Slack message.
        // Note: The pipeline doesn't have conditional logic. If no alert is found, this may send an empty message or fail gracefully.
        "service": "slack-webhook-rest",
        "method": "POST",
        "path": "/T012345/B67890/xyz...", // The unique part of the Slack webhook URL.
        "bodyMapping": { 
          "text": "anomalyResult.alert.message" // Get the alert message from the previous step's result.
        },
        "concurrent": true
      }
    ]
  }
}
```

#### **Advanced Logging Interface**
A dedicated, multi-tab interface for deep diving into gateway activity:

**Live Logs**
- WebSocket-powered, real-time stream of all logs from the gateway
- Filter logs by type (Gateway, Schema, Admin) and by Subgraph
- Instantly narrow down the firehose of information

**Historical Logs (Gateway, Schema, Admin)**
Query and analyze past events with a powerful and intuitive interface:
- **Timeframe Filtering**: Quickly select a time range from the last 5 minutes to the last 7 days
- **Subgraph/Service Filtering**: Drill down to logs from a specific subgraph
- **Keyword Search**: Perform full-text search across the entire log payload, including headers, bodies, and trace IDs
- **Manual Refresh**: Manually trigger a fetch for the latest logs within the selected timeframe
- **Pagination**: Efficiently navigate through thousands of log entries
- **Persistent Search**: Search terms are remembered across sessions

### üîç Diagnostic Endpoints

- **Simple Operations**: Sub-50ms response times for basic auth and validation
- **Moderate Pipelines**: 30-60ms for typical business logic workflows  
- **Complex Orchestrations**: 60-100ms for multi-service, transactional operations
- **High Reliability**: Near-zero failure rates under normal operating conditions

> **Note**: These results represent performance on modest hardware. Production deployments with dedicated infrastructure and optimized service instances will see significantly better performance.

    participant C as Client
    participant G as Gateway
    participant M as Pipeline Engine
    participant GS as GraphQL Services
    participant RS as REST Services
    participant D as Dashboard

    C->>G: GraphQL/REST Request
    G->>M: Execute Pre-Pipeline
    M->>GS: Route to GraphQL Service(s)
    M->>RS: Route to REST Service(s)

    M->>G: Execute Post-Pipeline  
    G-->>C: Final Response
    G->>D: Stream Logs
```

### üîÑ Request Lifecycle

1. **Pre-processing**: Authentication, validation, context injection (both GraphQL and REST)
2. **Service routing**: Intelligent load balancing across instances
3. **Response handling**: Data enrichment and transformation
4. **Post-processing**: Notifications, analytics, cleanup
5. **Observability**: Real-time logging and metrics

## üõ†Ô∏è Troubleshooting

### Common Issues & Solutions

| Issue | Solution |
|---|---|
| üî¥ Service not appearing | Check announcement frequency (e.g., every 30s) and network connectivity. |
| üü° Schema not updating | Validate schema format and check gateway logs for parsing or merging errors. |
| üü† Pre-pipeline not running | Ensure the service is announcing its middlewareMap or restPipelines correctly. |
| üîµ Dashboard not loading | Confirm admin token and WebSocket connectivity to the gateway. |
| üü£ REST endpoint not found | Check the path configuration and ensure the service type is set correctly. |

### Debug Commands

```bash
# Check gateway status
curl "http://localhost:5000/admin/gateway-status?token=${ADMIN_TOKEN}"

# View active services  
curl "http://localhost:5000/admin/services?token=${ADMIN_TOKEN}"

# Inspect pipeline configurations
curl "http://localhost:5000/admin/pipelines?token=${ADMIN_TOKEN}"

# Test REST endpoint directly
curl "http://localhost:5000/your-rest-path" -X POST
```
